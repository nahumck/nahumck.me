I'm always in search of the best possible charging solution for all my travel needs. I have some very simple requirements: it needs to be minimal and be capable of charging all my devices while on the go. It's evolved over time, and with some improvements to AirPods and MagSafe accessories, I've finally landed on what I think is the best possible solution for me. I say for me because your needs might be slightly different, but this is what works for me. 

Let's start with what devices I have so we can talk about how I charge them. For my personal devices, I'm still rocking the iPhone 14 Pro, the Apple Watch Ultra, the non-USB-C 2nd Gen AirPods Pro with MagSafe Case (this is important for later), and the M1 iPad Pro 12.9". 

With those devices in mind, I've settled on a scalable solution for how I work. At the center of this setup is the [Anker Prime 67W charger](https://amzn.to/3FenwDx). This has 2 USB-C ports and one USB-A. It has more than enough power to fast charge everything I have. To provide the most flexibility, I have two of these [multi-end cables](https://amzn.to/3YLVd7Q) that are USB-A/USB-C on one end, and USB-C/Lightning on the other. Each are 6' long so that they can reach most anywhere I am in relation to a power outlet, and I still have the ability to charge via Lightning for any of those devices that are still around.

Now I could just stop there, and plug each device into a cable. But sometimes when I travel, I don't have power available and I need an external battery to charge my devices. This is where an external battery pack is a great accessory to carry. For a while, I had a separate 10k mAh battery pack, but then I looked into the [OtterBox 2-in-1 Power Bank with MagSafe](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/HQ322ZM/A) – and it's a game changer for me. This device is not only a battery pack, but can act as a travel MagSafe charging stand for my phone, watch, and AirPods Pro; it even does pass-through charging, so I can leave it plugged in overnight and still use [StandBy](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-17-the-macstories-review/5/) like I do at home. And like I mentioned before, the AirPods Pro with MagSafe charging case makes this setup even better: I can use either magnetic charging targets on the Power Bank, or even use my second cable with Lightning to charge. I think that's a big advantage with the AirPods Pro that most people miss: the versatility of charging options.[^home]

[^home]: It's also changed my home setup, but I'll save that for another time.

There are some other bits that I might charge from time to time, like my [Apurture light](https://amzn.to/3hS18rw) or my [tactical flashlight](https://amzn.to/3WlBt9N), but everything in my charging setup can be used to charge those also. If I'm on a trip where I'm carrying a lot of peripherals or I need to bring my work laptop, I might bring bring an additional [charger](https://amzn.to/46KhCph) and [USB-C cable](https://amzn.to/3ZPizur) for the added power, a black braided USB-C to Lightning cable (that came with the Magic Trackpad), and an [Anker MagSafe Battery](https://amzn.to/3x8e5As). It just depends on the bag/carry I'm using at the time.

This entire solution – starting with the charging brick, cables, and batteries – is a very scalable travel MagSafe solution for me. It's extremely versatile for my devices, especially given that the AirPods Pro are able to charge via a MagSafe, Watch, or Lightning/USB-C (depending on which case you might have). I've finally arrived at my ideal travel charging solution, and really couldn't be happier.
