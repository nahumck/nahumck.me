With the latest update in the App Store, [2Do has gone free](http://www.2doapp.com/unchartered-waters/) for 14 days, with an in-app purchase to keep pro features. But the big news here: if you've ever wanted to try the app out in its full capability can now do so to see if [switching to 2Do](https://www.nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/) is right for them.

Although I am happy to support developers — as I've probably purchased hundreds of dollars of apps — I'm really happy to see this type of change for productivity apps. So many of these types of apps need to have sustainable business models to keep them around, and are worthy of a higher price. But many users are hesitant to buy before they try. I like that these apps are starting to explore the try-before-you-buy model, and I hope that it brings more revenue to the developers that deserve it.

As I've written [many times before](https://www.nahumck.me/tag/2do/), 2Do is the best task management system I have ever used on iOS, hands down. And I'm really excited about the potential of a big 4.0 release in the future, full of a long wishlist of new features.[^1]

If you've ever wondered what it was like to move to a new system, to try the best, now is your chance. What's holding you back? Nothing now - go get [2Do on the App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ&ct=ntwitter) for free (to try). And if you like it, get the IAP, and support its continued development.

[^1]: Not that I would ever send that to Fahad. Nope. Not me. I wouldn't send him a super-long list of things I'd love to see in the app, causing him to work night and day. Because that would be cruel. (Sorry Fahad. So sorry)
