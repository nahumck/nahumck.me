I've been asked a lot lately where people can get the workflows I've developed utilizing [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me), [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me), and [2Do](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) for the creation of tasks, projects, and checklists.

In short, they use the input from Drafts, which takes the `[[title]]` tag and places it on the clipboard, then passes the `[[body]]` to Workflow. For each line, the `|` delimiter for the notes of a given item.

Here are the latest Workflow workflows[1](#fn-538-1) and Drafts actions I've created for input, all in one handy place:

### Tasks

[Workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/5166add8ebfb4513bea1584085fb7848) [Drafts Action](https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1kO)

### Projects

[Workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/6867b65881fd4401984fdb90d286f96d) [Drafts Action](https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1kM)

### Checklists

[Workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/8a3b4354473e45b9a9485670e0f48763) [Drafts Action](https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1kN)

These can be customized to suit your needs. You could have multiple `|` delimiters to add tags or due dates/times or start dates; all you need to do is modify the workflow to include them.[2](#fn-538-2) You can also make a [Drafts Action Set](https://www.nahumck.me/using-action-sets-drafts/).

Go forth and automate your productivity!

_Update: I forgot that you will also need to have the [remove blank lines action](http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1ar) installed for the Drafts actions to work. I did that in case I had multiple blank lines in the draft. Sorry this wasn’t included before._
