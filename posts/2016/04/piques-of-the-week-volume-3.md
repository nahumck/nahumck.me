Here’s a few things that are piquing my interests this week:

## Monoprice Fastening Tape

[Jeff Mueller](http://jeffmueller.net/) mentioned this [life hack](http://theruncommuter.com/pack-hacks-how-to-tame-excess-backpack-straps/) to me after he purchased the same backpack that I did [a few weeks ago](https://www.nahumck.me/things-i-like-this-week-volume-2). By using this, you can get rid of the flapping straps using simple fastening tape.[^1]

I ended up purchasing the [yellow version](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004C4ZOBK/?tag=nahumck-20) because I not only wanted to have something other than plain black, but I wanted something that would help me easily identify my bag if I ever needed to check it or set it somewhere.[^2]

Not a bad deal for about $5.

## Copied

This app was of zero use to me when I picked it up. I’ve never really warmed up to having a clipboard manager before. But that was before Gabe had [another terrific idea](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/04/copied-app-for-snippet-management.html) for using it not only as a text replacement tool[\[3\]](#fn-3 "see footnote"), but for something that holds affiliate links, animated GIFs, email signatures, etc. I’ve moved a lot of stuff out of [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) that really belonged in a clipboard manager.

To unlock the power of [Copied](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me), you'll need to get the $2 IAP. This unlocks the ability to have multiple lists of your choosing, backups to iCloud for syncing your iOS devices.[\[4\]](#fn-4 "see footnote") This has been so helpful to me in just such a short time. I highly recommend picking this up.

## Coda

How on earth did I run my site without Coda?

[Coda](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda/id500906297?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) is from the fine folks over at [Panic](https://panic.com/), makers of other fine apps like [Prompt](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt-2/id917437289?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me), and [Transmit](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit/id917432930?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me).[\[5\]](#fn-5 "see footnote")

Coda is an editor for multiple web languages; I’ve been using it for HTML & CSS. It is specifically designed to manage your site via FTP, allowing you to manipulate & customize your site. I’m just barely scratching the surface, but I can already appreciate what it will help me do in the future.

8. There’s a separate app for [Copied on the Mac](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1026349850?&at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) that you’ll need to buy if you use a Mac. It syncs using iCloud. I’ve not used it, but I also don’t regularly use a Mac. [ ↩](#fnref-4 "return to article")

10. There are also Mac apps for [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/) and [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) if you’re interested in those. [ ↩](#fnref-5 "return to article")
