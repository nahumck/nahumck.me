From [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-found-40-million-gold-221341958.html):

> "Apple recovered 2,204 pounds of gold â€” well over a ton.
> 
> At the current spot price of $1,229.80 per troy ounce of gold, Apple recovered just under $40 million in gold from old phones and computers."
