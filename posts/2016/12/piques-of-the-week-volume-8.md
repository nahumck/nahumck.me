## Activity Tracking / Sharing

The gamification of this is really good. I had a Fitbit before, and it was all about step count. But now that I have a Watch, it's much more about being up and active. With watchOS 3, Activity Sharing was added: this allows users of the Apple Watch to view not only their fitness data, but their trusted friends as well. Within my ring circle of friends, it's been nice to motivate each other into doing a little more, even when we aren't talking. I can see that [Sam](https://twitter.com/mrbeefy/ "Sam Davies on Twitter") just rode his bike, I can tell that [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jeffmueller/ "Jeff Mueller on Twitter") has hit the treadmill - and I can feel like I'm not doing enough and get after it.

We also get to send responses when someone hits an achievement, which we have made more fun by using the standard responses of the watch. I can be encouraging, or I can be sarcastic. I'm not seeing the results I want to see in my health just as yet, but I know I will be soon. And I'm happy that my friends will also get to encourage me along the way and share in the fun.

## Watch Bands

One surprising bit for me has been the customization. I'm really enjoying the swapping of bands, the changing of watch faces,[1](#fn1) and the unique way I can match all of this to the outfit or activity I am doing at the time. And while I'm not going to get all crazy and buy every band out there, having some options has been really great.

Currently, I have a couple of third-party bands that I really like. Aside from the black sport band that came with it, I also have a [concrete-colored band](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LX9ZIEK/?tag=nahumck-20 "Concrete Sport Band on Amazon") that is the same. Well, _nearly_ the same. Apple's material feels better, is likely better made, and will likely last longer over time; however, for $8-10 per band, I can get five of the 3rd-party bands for the price of one Apple band. When the Nike Apple Watch was announced, I liked the look of the new band; the fluoroelastomer bands can retain heat/sweat, and the [Nike band](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCVMC2W/?tag=nahumck-20 "Black/Grey Nike Band on Amazon") seems to be better at reducing the amount. I also got a [nylon band](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HQ00IY4/?tag=nahumck-20 "Black Woven Nylon Band on Amazon") that is extremely similar to Apple's version, but for less than a third of the price. I wanted to get something fancy, but thanks to trade with a friend of mine, I now have a [Milanese loop](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016JWO0HQ/?tag=nahumck-20 "Milanese Loop Band on Amazon") that has quickly become my favorite band. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I have, but it's really, really great.

I'm sure I'll get more bands, and I'll likely have to get help for the amount that I ultimately get. But I'm trying to keep it limited, trying to keep it fun and interesting, and have something that's personal to me. I'm digging it.

_Note: when ordering bands, especially on Amazon, make sure you are ordering the correct size for your watch. The links above are for the 42mm M/L size bands, where applicable._

## Anker Power Charger

I had purchased one of these for my wife a while ago, as she was charging multiple devices by her side of the bed. I had just been using the power bricks that came with my devices. But right after getting the Apple Watch, I needed to change this. It had become cumbersome. So, I ordered the [Anker 40W/8A 5-Port USB Charger PowerPort 5](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VH8ZW02/?tag=nahumck-20 "Anker 40W/8A 5-Port USB Charger PowerPort 5 on Amazon") for my own use. And although I didn't get in time for a recent business trip, now that I have it at home, the cord management has never been easier. Couple this with a few [Monoprice Cable Ties](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008F28WB4/?tag=nahumck-20 "Monoprice Cable Ties (Multicolor) on Amazon") - power & cord mischief is managed.

1. I'm hopeful that Apple will allow custom watch faces at some point in the future. [â†©](#ffn1)
