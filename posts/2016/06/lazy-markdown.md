No, this isn’t a new fork of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). This is just a better way of doing things.

[Jeff Mueller](http://jeffmueller.net) recently came up with a [clever way](http://jeffmueller.net/2016/06/10/lazy-markdown-links-with-workflow/) to use [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) to help pull in links after writing a post in [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me). It’s seriously a fantastic idea that I wish I had thought of before.

After he sent it to me to check out, I thought of another use of Markdown links that I use: [Blink](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/blink-better-affiliate-links/id946766863?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) affiliate links. After some quick changes to Jeff’s original workflow, I came up with a [new one](https://workflow.is/workflows/4f0c2df4c4254822b3ded984164ffe48) that allows you to select where the link is coming from: you can choose Search, Blink, or manual entry of the URL (note that this requires Workflow 1.5.1 to work).[^1]

This is extremely helpful for writing. As Jeff said:

> “I love these workflows because they let me focus on writing. The research can come later.”

And he’s 100% right. Little hooks like this allow me to focus on writing, rather than doing all of the little things. It’s the reason why [Drafts is my main text editor](https://www.nahumck.me/using-drafts-as-a-main-text-editor/), and I keep finding more and more reasons to keep using it.

1. I am hopeful that the same functionality will come with a future update of [Associate](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/associate-simple-affiliate/id1083291558?at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumck_me) and that Workflow will implement this quickly so I can incorporate Amazon links too.
