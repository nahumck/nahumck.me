### Reduce Tumbler 2-pack

![](/images/Reduce-Tumbler.jpeg)

I've wanted a stainless steel tumbler for a long time. I've owned several vacuum-insulated tumblers in the past, but they are all plastic and break over time (especially if accidentally dropped). I looked for alternatives, and found several brands: Yeti, Rtic, and many more that are all about the same. All of them were anywhere from $15-40 for a single tumbler.

On a recent trip to Costco, however, I found a 2-pack of the [Reduce Cold-1 30oz tumblers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9SIHL0/?tag=nahumck-20 "Reduce Cold-1 30oz tumbler (2-pack)") for $20. I thought I would give them a shot. And I'm a big believer in them now. The day I brought them home (at about 2pm) I washed them, and put ice in my tumbler. I refilled the water several times for the remainder of the day. I placed the cup next to my bedside and fell asleep. When I woke in the morning, I grabbed my tumbler and to my surprise - there was still ice in there!

I highly recommend these if you get the chance to pick them up. I included the Amazon link, but if you live near a Costco, you can save some cash by picking them up there.

### Rinfit Silicone Wedding Bands

![](/images/Rinfit-Silicone-Wedding-Bands.jpeg)

My wife and I have never had our rings re-dipped since we've been married, and I thought this year would be a good year to do it. Additionally, there have been times at work that I have been messing with electrical equipment, and my wife's rings don't quite fit her.

So I started looking for alternatives to wear while we get our wedding bands all fixed up. I stumbled upon the Rinfit line of silicone wedding bands. I was able to pick up a simple [men's band](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ELI7ZJU/?tag=nahumck-20 "Rinfit Men's Silicone Wedding Band - Black") in black, and picked up a multi-color pack of [women's bands](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFGQ8Y4/?tag=nahumck-20 "Rinfit Women's Silicone Wedding Bands - 5 pack") for my wife. We are both really please with how well they fit and how they can adapt as our hands expand/contract with heat and cold. As an added benefit, I won't get electrical shocks from this at work. Maybe I won't miss that metallic taste in my mouth after allâ€¦
