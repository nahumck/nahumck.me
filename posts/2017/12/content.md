I'm usually stir-crazy when I use something for so long. I get antsy about what I'm doing, feel the need to change it all up, and try new things. But every-so-often, I end up finding that perfect blend of things that I need. I finally feel like I've hit a sweet spot for my task management workflow.

There have been changes that have lead to this: first, I strengthened my use of [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ) for [trusted capture](https://www.nahumck.me/trusted-capture-with-drafts/); this has allowed me to have one central place to enter everything and is engrained in my muscle memory. Then, I focused on how I get my information on a daily basis, which led me to the use of [Reminders and the Siri Watch Face](https://www.nahumck.me/keep-it-simple/). I can use the Apple Watch as a tool to see what is coming next and focus my attention on my next action; I've even started using the Siri watch face in conjunction with my calendar, so that I can better map out my day. And when I started using the [very surprising](https://www.nahumck.me/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise/) [GoodTask](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ), it has all come together in a great new package.

I don't feel the need to change anything, and I'm sure I could improve my workflow by automating it a bit more. I just don't feel like moving around apps and finding something else to distract me from what I'm doing. I'm sure there are some things that will change in the future.[1](#fn1) But for now, I'm content with what I have, and that's enough for me.

1. I know that Drafts 5 is coming, and I'm sure a GoodTask 4 is as well. Both will elevate my productivity to a new level I didn't previously have. Stay tuned for that. [â†©](#ffn1)
