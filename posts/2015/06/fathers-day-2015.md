This morning, as with many weekend mornings, I was awoken by my youngest son. “Hi Daddy! Boo!” It was 6:30am, and although it is a perfectly reasonable time for me to be awake, I was hoping to get at least a little bit of extra sleep.

He noticed that I didn’t have a shirt on. “Daddy, shirt!” (I’m not sure if it was because I normally sleep with one on, or if he is making a passive-aggressive attempt at calling me fat, but I digress…) He then proceeded to go over to the dresser, and open up my t-shirt drawer. He grabbed the first shirt he could, and brought it over to me. “Here Daddy! Come on! Downstairs!”

Although he woke me up early, I couldn’t be more proud of him. He’s learning so much, and he is such a polite boy. He always says thank you, and most times says please.

I’m sure I did similar things when I was a kid with my dad (probably not as gracious, however). Perhaps it was even worse for my dad. One thing is for sure — he’s proud of his grandson in two ways: 1) for being a polite, sweet, smart boy and 2) for waking his daddy up because it’s payback for the times that I did it to him!

Happy Father’s Day to all the fathers out there, and most of all to the wonderful example that I have in my life. Love you, Dad!
