For a long time, I have wanted a site to call mine. Sure, I‚Äôve had my blog a little while. But I really wanted to have my own domain.

This past week, I had an epiphany: it was something that made me feel more alive than I have in a long time. The notes that I took for my idea was a bit crazy, very ambitious, but yet calming and _attainable_.[^1]

I ended up buying two: one with future intentions, and one that I wanted to use here. So, I went to the place that everyone (and the mother of any podcaster out there) will tell you to use: Hover. And every single top-level domain (TLD) for ‚Äúnahumck‚Äù was available. This should shock exactly no one.

Now that I had nahumck.me[^2], I needed to link it to my site. I‚Äôve had a WP.com site for a long time, but it was their web address. I wanted it to be fully mine (did you notice the address bar at the top?). Again, I ultimately wanted simple, so I kept my site at Wordpress after some back and forth with other options. And aside from the theme I chose that spruced up the joint, the rest should be transparent to you.[^3]

Now that the site is set up and done, I can finish a few more workflows, and then get to what I‚Äôve always intended this to be - a place for me to share my thoughts. I can get to writing to help me. And if I get lucky, perhaps I will help someone else along the way.

Welcome to the new site!

I wanted to say a very special thanks to [Seth Clifford](http://twitter.com/sethclifford). He has helped with a lot of guidance this week. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate his help and his friendship.üíô

[^1]: More on this at a later date.
[^2]: Yes, Rob ‚Äî I know that nahumck.plumbing was available. And although I considered it, the .me is better. So sorry.
[^3]: If I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs probably transparent to me also. I‚Äôm not a whiz at this stuff.
