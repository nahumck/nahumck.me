As of late, I have had a lot of things on my plate. Life has had its series of challenges for myself and my family, which has lead to neglect of several things in my life. I am the single biggest thing I neglect. As a part of that, I like writing. I’m not particularly great at it. But I don’t have to be. And that’s the point — I just need to do it. It doesn’t have to be long. It doesn’t have to be good. It just needs to be. So hopefully with the implementation of a few key things based on the suggestion of friends and family, I will be writing more about things I love, things I hate, and everything in between.(And if I can figure it all out, it will be on a new website - because it's 2015 and I need something better than what I have.)

More to come…
