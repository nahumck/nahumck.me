Me, writing for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/):

> Drafts 5 was recently updated to version 5.4, which brings a host of new features. While there is support for iOS 12's Siri shortcuts and all that they have to offer, there are also other important features that have improved the app's capabilities significantly.

It's a really great release. And I was thrilled to write it for MacStories. If you haven't checked it out, head on over and read it there.
