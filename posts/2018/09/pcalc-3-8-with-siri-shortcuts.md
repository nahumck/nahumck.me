Federico Viticci, writing for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/pcalc-3-8-adds-support-for-ios-12s-siri-shortcuts-including-powerful-clipboard-commands/):

> Even though I don't consider myself an advanced PCalc user (I mostly use the app for conversions and basic operations), I've grown to appreciate the convenience of running frequent calculations with Siri and I've started integrating PCalc with the Shortcuts app in some interesting ways. As a result of its adoption of Siri shortcuts in iOS 12, my overall usage of PCalc has increased: I don't necessarily open the app more often, but I access native PCalc features either via Siri or Shortcuts from all of my devices.

I own [PCalc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id284666222?at=1001l4VZ) and use it often for work. I use it in my widget as well. But I really don't use it much more beyond that. Reading what Federico has done with the app has me wanting to try a bunch of new things with the world's best calculator.

I'm excited to see this integration via Siri Shortcuts, and I'm intrigued by the possibilities that lie ahead with other apps providing the same integrations.
