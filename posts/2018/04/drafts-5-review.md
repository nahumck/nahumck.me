My review of Drafts is out. But it's not here, not exactly anywayâ€¦

[**Drafts 5: The MacStories Review**](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/)

I reached out to Federico a year ago and asked if he had anyone slated to write the review.[^1] I suggested to him that I would like to write it for MacStories, that I would be happy to do so. It wasn't long before he responded "yes, let's do this".

It was an amazing experience. As the production of the review progressed, that feeling only increased. The entire Team at MacStories has been delightful to work with, and I couldn't be happier than I am now with everything that has transpired over the past few months. It has been an honor to work with that team!

Writing while [Greg](https://mobile.twitter.com/agiletortoise) was developing Drafts 5 through the beta process was a valuable insight into app development. It is rare to directly see the careful consideration an app developer makes when rolling out new features. Using the Slack channel as a sounding board, he would often listen to the suggestions being made; if he ever thought it was the wrong thing to do, he would state why instead of just "no". I know he has more planned for the future, and I'll be sure to follow-up when he does.

You can read the review at the link above. And if you aren't a member of [Club MacStories](https://club.macstories.net/), you should sign up: there's an ePub version of this as well.

Thanks again to [Federico](https://mobile.twitter.com/viticci) and the team at MacStories for giving me the opportunity to write for them, and for you the readers. This has been a labor of love for me, and I hope that shows through in the review.

Thanks to all of you for reading!

[^1]: I cannot believe that it has been a year.
