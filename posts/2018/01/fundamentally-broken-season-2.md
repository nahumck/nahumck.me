We've started the second season… series… whatever of [the show](http://podcast.fundamentallybroken.men). This entire run will be focused mainly on task management. It won't be about the apps we use,[1](#fn1) but rather the feelings behind the how, why, and what of our task management. We're really excited about it, and we hope you are too.

If you're interested, feel free to give it a listen wherever you get your [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fundamentally-broken/id1200632692) podcasts, or give it a listen below. You may need to reload without content blockers to show the mini-player below. _(Note: this podcast does - for a reason - contain the explicit tag. Not recommended for listening around your kids. You've been warned.)_
