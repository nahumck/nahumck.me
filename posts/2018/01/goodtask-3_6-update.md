There has been an update released today for my task management app of choice, [GoodTask](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ). There is a lot to unpack with this update; you can read more in the [full details](https://medium.com/p/goodtask-for-ios-3-6-update-7afa59f59709) for the update.

There are some great things that I want to quickly highlight:

- **Full Drag/Drop support**: There is a comprehensive list found in the full details. A couple of really nice touches include the ability to drag one or more tasks onto another task to create subtasks. You can also drag subtasks out to be full tasks.
- **Smart Button**: Navigating your lists is now easier than ever.
- **Enhanced Tasks page**: if you swipe from left to right on a task, it now puts you into the Quick Actions screen of your task. From there, you can use swipe to go to the other screens or the buttons at the top to change from screen to screen.
- **Subtasks**: Subtasks have been improved by including them inline as part of the task. This allows you to see what is left of a small project and move forward.

I'm sure I'm missing some items, but it's the things that are making me stick with this. I'm absolutely loving my time with GoodTask.

GoodTask is [available on the App Store for Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ&ct=nahumckme) with an optional (but _highly_ recommended) IAP of $5.
