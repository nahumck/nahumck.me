[![Tactical Bag](/images/9B87D582-CE30-421D-BBC5-9789E93B7300-360x450.jpeg)](https://www.nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/9B87D582-CE30-421D-BBC5-9789E93B7300.jpeg)

For a while now, I've had the same [backpack](http://www.ospreypacks.com/us/en/product/momentum-30-MOMENTUM30.html). It's been my trusted bag for everything: work, travel, day tripping, etc. It carries everything I could think about needing and then some. But with some changes in my needs, I started realizing that for some situations – like going to my 3rd office that is known as Chipotle – it's way more than I need. I need something smaller on the weekends when I'm not lugging my work laptop around.[1](#fn-1530-laptop)

I needed something smaller, compact, focused. I needed a _**tactical**_ bag.

So in my quest, I started thinking about what I would need for a trip for personal life, excluding work from it completely. I started developing a list of what I would need at any given time while on the go, and I was intentionally thinking of what I really _needed_ for a day run anywhere I was going. I had some other needs as well: I wanted it to be as small as possible, have some RFID shielding, and also provide some anti-theft options. I did a lot of searching, and even asked Seth – the man who has a bag for damn near anything – about what he uses for this purpose. He had recently picked up the [Pacsafe Vibe 325](https://www.rei.com/product/110915/pacsafe-vibe-325-crossbody-bag). It looked like a great bag, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.[2](#fn-1530-rei) But when I looked for that bag on Amazon, I found a few other bags that caught my eye.

After a bit of sifting, I ended up finding the [Travelon Anti-Theft Urban Sling Bag](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3S0BE0/?tag=nahumck-20). While it doesn't look tactical the way a GO RUCK bag does, this thing just screams urban tactical. Even though this is a small carry, it's large enough for me to overpack it and get a lot inside of it. I ended up getting black, even though there is a gray option I might have liked more, because it blends seamlessly with the zippers.

There are a lot of anti-theft details of this bag: there are locking zippers to keep the compartments secure as you are moving around; the bag and straps have reinforced, anti-slash materials to keep the bag from being cut off my body; and the area for cards/passports are RFID shielded. These features make it a great bag for going around town, traveling to a big city via plane, train, or bicycle. I can even put a water bottle or [Yeti tumbler](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJX9ZV/?tag=nahumck-20) on either side for travel.

With this bag, I'm able to fit most of what I carry on a normal basis. In the bag, I have:

1. [iPad Pro 11"](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3CJQ1F/?tag=nahumck-20) with [Smart Keyboard Folio](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MU8G2LL/A) and [Apple Pencil](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=nahumck-20)
2. [Anker Wall Charger](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H54MKQY/?tag=nahumck-20) with USB-C and USB-A ports
3. Cord organizer containing: [Anker Powerline+ USB-C to USB-C cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LNA0XCU/?tag=nahumck-20), [Anker Powerline+ USB-C to Lightning cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4VL3JU/?tag=nahumck-20), [Apple USB-C to Lightning cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGYJBQA/?tag=nahumck-20), and the [Satechi Mobile Pro Hub](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6YFW7X/?tag=nahumck-20)[3](#fn-1530-gift)
4. [Airpods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/)
5. [Foldable Wallet Stand](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01959FPCY/?tag=nahumck-20)
6. [Glyf by Studio Neat](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WKTMPQ/?tag=nahumck-20)
7. [Joby Gorilla Pod](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B074WG1ZTJ/?tag=nahumck-20)
8. [Magnetic Flashlight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018IMJT9O/?tag=nahumck-20)[4](#fn-1530-local)
9. [Knife](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000U7LU20/?tag=nahumck-20)
10. [Pen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCPKT5K/?tag=nahumck-20)
11. [microfiber cloth](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008FPTID2/?tag=nahumck-20)
12. A collapsible, reusable grocery bag in case I need increase my storage in an emergency, similar to [these](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005ZV91T0/?tag=nahumck-20)
13. [Glasses case](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KMSOT3I/?tag=nahumck-20) - usually carried on the side
14. [reduce Water Bottle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0728DSC4D/?tag=nahumck-20)
15. Personal items: Passport, corporate AMEX, a Visa gift card (for emergencies only), Kleenex, Boogie Wipes, Purell, Carmen lip balm, nail clippers, and flushable wipes

That's a lot for me to carry on any given day; I don't carry all of the items all the time, but it's nice to know that I can if I want to do so. And while my goal of this bag was to be light-carry, this bag makes all of this _feel_ minimal when I'm out and about, even when it's packed full.

I really love the way this has turned out. I wish I could use this all the time, but there are some things that I do need to carry during the weekday which force me to use my backpack. There is, however, a clear delineation with which bag I grab now. But for the times where I need to be minimal while still being dangerous, this will be my go-to tactical bag for the future.

2. Funny thing is that I decreased the weight of my work laptop by 4 lbs, but yet I still find carrying the thing a pain in my ass. [↩](#fnref-1530-laptop)

4. He got it for free based on his REI dividend. [↩](#fnref-1530-rei)

6. This was a Secret Santa gift given to me by my cousin. It's monogrammed on the front as well. It's perfect for what I need. [↩](#fnref-1530-gift)

8. I got this at a local store. This is the best approximation of what I have. Cannot say I recommend it because I didn't buy this exact one, but it's similar. YMMV. [↩](#fnref-1530-local)
