[Drafts 15](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&at=1001l4VZ) has been released to support both iOS and the new iPadOS 13. And as it is with the major releases, I had the opportunity to write about it over at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-15-review-multiwindow-shortcuts-and-more/).

I encourage everyone to go read it there, but wanted to offer a couple of highlights:

- **Enhanced Shortcuts Support**: the support for Shortcuts has been very well implemented and enables users to not only create, but to pull from drafts without opening Drafts itself.
- **Multiwindow Support for iPadOS**: this is another game-changing feature, and is the cornerstone of this release. This will empower users to create new ways of working on their iPad, allowing users to integrate Drafts into more of their daily lives. I give a few examples here. For more on how Multiwindow works, I recommend reading [Federico's review](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/) and watching [Chris Lawley's video](https://youtu.be/x-vISTePKSk), which provide the overview for all of iOS/iPadOS 13.
- **Updated Interface**: there are a multitude of improvements here, from iconography to re-written UI to contextual menus, new in iOS 13.

This is a fantastic update, and has once again changed the way I use my devices with Drafts. In addition, it's streamlined my workflows and opened up new possibilities for me. I hope that everyone finds more and more use cases for Drafts going forward.
