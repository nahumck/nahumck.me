For many years, [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001l4VZ) has been _the_ place on iOS where text starts. But for all of those years, there has been a missing component: a macOS counterpart.

**That ends today.**

[Drafts for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1435957248?mt=12) has finally been released to the public. Last time there was a major release, I wrote the [Macstories Review](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/). But when it comes to a Mac and how best to integrate Drafts into the macOS ecosystem, I'm simply not the right person to do the review justice. But thankfully, one of my favorite internet people reached out to me privately about writing the review for it, and I was thrilled to even be asked. To be clear: they didn't owe me that, but it is honestly a nice feeling to feel respected within this community. They also reached out to Federico about writing for MacStories, and he agreed.

So, it's my pleasure to point you not here for a review, but over to MacStories where [Rosemary Orchard](https://twitter.com/RosemaryOrchard/) has written a [review of Drafts for Mac](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-mac/). It's most of what I wanted to see when I wrote up my [Drafts 5.0 wishlist](https://www.nahumck.me/drafts-5-0-a-wish-list/) months ago: a way to edit the notes on the Mac so that users didn't have to roll a different solution or pass notes back and forth in odd ways. What the new macOS app provides is exactly that, along with workspaces, themes, tagging, etc.

What don't you get: the actions that Drafts is famous for on iOS.

Remember: this is a v1.0 application, not the v5.7 application that we have on iOS. It's going to take time to get there. The platforms are different: this isn't a "Marzipan" app, this is a full-fledged macOS app written from the ground up. Things will take time to get there. The macOS app does have the advantage of already having a rich ecosystem of automation apps to pull from, like Automator and Keyboard Maestro, so there are already was to implement some automation.

I'm really happy with the macOS version. For me, it is exactly what I need: a way to view and edit my drafts on the Mac for the single purpose podcasting. Perhaps my needs will change in the future, just like Drafts' place in the Apple ecosystem now that Drafts for Mac is finally here.
