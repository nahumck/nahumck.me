Well, hello.

It is with heavy hearts (and overtaxed livers) that we tell you we just don't have it in us anymore to keep on going. It's time to take Fundamentally Broken out behind the woodshed and put it down humanely.

Go ahead now, turn away. You don't need to see this.

The past year or so since we last recorded has certainly had some ups and downs. It came a lot of new responsibilities for both of us at work, and frankly at home too. Our lives — like everyone else's — were disrupted beyond any rational comprehension, and we found we didn't have the bandwidth to get on and record conversations anymore. We still talk almost every day, and Tim often says "fuck, why aren't we recording this" and we laugh, but the honest truth is that we're just not interested in producing this type of content for an audience right now, and collectively we just don't have the time.

So we hatched a plan to keep the show alive in spite of the fact that we weren't going to keep doing it. Seth suggested we find a new home for it on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) and Tim looked into it. The Internet Archive is something that the world desperately needs, and we always find delight when we head there. In fact, it's one of our annual donations because we believe in the mission and the people behind it.

We've [created a page](https://www.nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/) and the show will be available there from now on.[^1] It doesn't make sense to keep paying for podcast-specific accounts for a show we aren't doing, and this way, it's still available for the eleven people (looking at you, Japan) who might ever want to hear it, and it becomes a part of the great ocean that is the 1s and 0s of the past.

We'd personally like to thank everyone who _did_ listen. Your feedback and enthusiasm was a constant surprise to us, and we really appreciated it. We started the show because we thought there might be a place for a simple, honest conversation about a lot of things that interested or troubled us, and the response we received was that we were right about that. It resonated with people, and that was encouraging.

But like in all things, time and life change who we are and what we do, and now we set this little ship ablaze and push it out to sea, gazing fondly as it floats further from us.

Maybe we'll do it again someday. Maybe we won't. That's the beauty of the future. You just never know.

~ Seth & Tim
