As the new season of WWDC has closed, the time for sharing the beta screenshots is upon us. And while I love to see framed images, my preferred way of sharing is frameless. And there's no better tool for that than [FrameShot](https://www.keiransell.com/frameshot) for iPhones, developed by my friend Keir.[^keir]

[^keir]: Keir, chosen one, Keir. Keir, brilliant one, Keir.

I've used a version of the shortcut before, but Keir has taken it upon himself to add not only my favorite frameless but also framed as well, all in 3 different background choices: light, dark, or transparent. You can download the shortcuts from the link above to try them out.

I'm super pleased with these, and I will likely start using the transparent option almost exclusively for beautiful images of my homescreen.[^beta]

[^beta]: But maybe when the new releases hit in the fall. I think I'll hold off on the beta.
