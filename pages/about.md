I created this website as a place for my own self-interests, and to make a little mark in this world. The site, like me, is a work in progress. I’ll often write of my task management, my helpful tips, and the things that are piquing my interest. I’m trying to better myself as a human, and might write about that from time to time as well. It’s all a process.

I co-hosted the [Fundamentally Broken](http://podcast.fundamentallybroken.men) podcast, a show about how Seth Clifford and I work through our ever-changing lives using evolving methodologies. It was cathartic. It was fulfilling. It was vulgar. It was our show. And now it’s in a [better place](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%28Seth%20Clifford%20%26%20Tim%20Nahumck%29)…

I’ve also been on other podcasts as a guest and written for other sites. You can view a full list [here](https://www.nahumck.me/appearances/).

I am a husband to the most [wonderful wife](https://www.nahumck.me/this-is-40/), and a proud father to 2 sons whom are 11 years apart. We had the [most wonderful puppy](https://www.nahumck.me/on-difficult-decisions/) in the world, and sometime soon, will have another. I am currently an engineering manager in the automotive industry.
